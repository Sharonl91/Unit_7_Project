The PackageSimulator class is designed to be allow the user to simulate some number of packages

        A PackageSimulator object should contain an ArrayList of Package objects that starts off as empty.
It should contain a method called generatePackages that takes in an integer as a parameter that represents how many packages to generate.
The package generated should be "smart." You need to generate real zip codes and create packages based on this information.
        For this simulation, make the addresses domestic (US only)
You will need to research zip codes and general averages for package sizes and weights.
It should contain a method called generateTotalCost that calculates the cost of every package simulated and returns it as a double.
It should contain a method called getSimulationInfo that returns all of the simulation info in the format specified at the beginning of the document.
It should contain a method called resetSimulation that will reset the ArrayList of Packages to empty.
